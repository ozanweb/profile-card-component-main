## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Resets (Source is below)
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

- It is possible to add two different background in one element.
- I have noticed that ```overflow: hidden``` doesn't work when the ```vw``` and ```vh``` units are used determining the width or height of the elements.

### Continued development

- Mastering CSS flex properties further

### Useful resources

- [CSS Resets](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - This helps you if you really want to start from scratch.
